		Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. - Warren Buffett<br>

		I love creating solutions to the challenging technical problems our society faces today. Due to the nature of the work I am interested in, I felt that studying Computer Science would be most adequate for solving problems of this kind. I am excited to continue in this effort when I begin my career as a technologist at Goldman Sachs.<br>

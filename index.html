			Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. - Warren Buffett<br>

			I love working on problems that we wouldn't dream of being able to solve without computers.
			Due to the nature of this problem set, naturally, I pursued a degree in Computer Science.

			I have spent almost three years working at Goldman Sachs and am currently on the Delta One desk writing
			trading software. Outside of my day job I spend as much time as I can learning. I cannot wait to
            see what computers have in store for us and what our world will look like in the coming years.<br>

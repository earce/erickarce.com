    These are some ideas that would be awesome to see implemented, drawn from conversations, experiences
    and dealing with impracticalities of existing solutions.

<div class="sections">Crowd-sourced route planning in 3rd world countries</div>
    <br>
    For anyone living in major metropolitan areas in the United States, the convenience of apps like Google Maps,
    Waze and Uber to give you real time scheduling and route planning during travels is something taken for granted.
    However many 3rd world countries don't have the same experience, and a crowd-sourced platform using individual users
    as data points and for live feedback could dramatically improve this experience.

<div class="sections">A True Cloud OS</div>
    <br>
    An implementation of Google Drive on steroids would be very close to this. But following that paradigm and being able
    to login from any browser and see your "desktop" frozen as you left it on a previous computer. Offering all
    applications one might download on a computer, video editing, software editing audio, text processing, the applications
    you can't yet get on Google Play or App Store might completely eliminate the need for a computer that would have
    to render anything more then a browser. I had embarked on an endeavor to create something like this in college. But
    it was above my ability at the time and required a lot more resources then I had.

<div class="sections">QR/Barcode Based Bibliography Generator</div>
    <br>
    This would require some coordination with academia and any content generator, but most individuals having attended
    college or high school have experienced having to fill out EasyBib and other works cited generators. Having all
    resources published, add a QR/Barcode code to their academic paper, books, website articles would make this process
    painless and eliminate any room for error while citing sources.
